# Assortment Funnel Analysis – Campaign Performance Optimization

### 📌 Project Overview
This SQL-based project focused on analyzing the **assortment funnel** for selected product categories where a **decline in growth** was observed. The goal was to identify **funnel drop-off points** and uncover actionable insights to drive performance improvement.

### 🧩 Problem Statement
Certain categories showed **degrowth** despite active campaigns. The objective was to investigate whether the issue stemmed from product visibility, availability, or customer purchase behavior within the funnel.

### ⚙️ Approach
Using SQL, I developed a query that consolidated product-level metrics (visibility, impressions, add-to-cart, and sales) across multiple months and brands.  
The analysis helped visualize the **assortment funnel** at various stages:
- **Visible Products**  
- **Purchasable Products**  
- **Viewed & Added-to-Cart Products**  
- **Sold Products**

By breaking down performance per **seller**, **brand**, and **category**, I pinpointed where the funnel conversion was weakening.

### 🧠 Key Insight
The analysis revealed that the funnel **was breaking at the Add-to-Cart stage** — customers were adding items but not purchasing them.  
A deeper review identified **high shipping charges** and **inflated prices** as the primary friction points.

### 🚀 Outcome
After collaborating with sellers to **adjust pricing and shipping costs**, the campaign observed:
- Noticeable **uplift in conversions**
- **Improved cart-to-purchase ratio**
- Enhanced overall category performance

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction, aggregation, and funnel calculation  
- **Power BI** – Visualization and performance tracking (automated via SQL views)  
- **Excel** – Cross-validation and summary reporting  

### 📈 Impact
This analysis directly contributed to:
- **Data-driven decision-making** at category and seller level  
- **Faster campaign optimization** through automated SQL data feeds  
- **Improved revenue performance** through actionable assortment insights

Would you like me to make this look more **corporate-styled** (like a professional case study with cleaner headings and minimal emoji) or keep this slightly **modern & readable** GitHub tone?
